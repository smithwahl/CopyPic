# CopyPic
A project to help organize all my pictures.

# Overview
My wife and I have over 100K pictures in our repository. When I started to organize them, I found that they were all over the place for no apparent reason. I wanted to build a quick and dirty application that would help me put them all in the right place.

The Application is a WPF form with a class that handles the copy. It has some basic capabilities to make sure that we don't have multiple copies. But it can be better.

# Things to do
I want to add some other capabilities:
  - Check all the images for duplicates
  - Check if an image is a modification of another image
